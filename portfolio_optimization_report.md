## Executive Summary

Your portfolio shows strong technical skills and project diversity, but needs significant optimization to attract digital marketing recruiters. The current presentation lacks the impact, metrics, and professional polish expected for SEO, analytics, and campaign strategy roles.

**Current Strengths:**

- Shows actual campaign data and visualizations
- Multi-disciplinary approach (email, social, photography)

**Critical Areas for Improvement:**
- Weak headline and value proposition
- Missing quantifiable results and ROI metrics
- Poor visual hierarchy and professional design
- Lack of strategic thinking demonstration
- No client testimonials or case studies

## Page-by-Page Audit

### üè† Homepage Analysis

**Current Issues:**

- **Weak value proposition**: Doesn't clearly state what makes you unique or your specialization
- **Missing key metrics**: No compelling statistics or achievements upfront
- **Basic design**: Lacks modern, professional aesthetic expected in digital marketing

- No mention of specific tools (GA4, SEMrush, Meta Ads Manager, etc.)
- Missing industry experience or niches
- No social proof or client results

### üìÅ Projects Page Analysis
